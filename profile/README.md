# Fokoos Friends

There is a fantastic community of people around the [Fokoos](https://www.fokoostech.com/) 3D-Printers. This community is mostly concentrated in a Facebook Group with it's inherent limitations.

This Github organisation was created to have a central place to gather all acquired knowledge, tips, tricks, models and software involving the Fokoos Odin FDM printers.

If you have anything that can help the rests of the community; feel free to add, amend or edit the content in these repositories.

Currently most information is in the [FokoosFriends Wiki](docs/wiki/).
