# Fokoos Friends

There is a fantastic community of people around the [Fokoos](https://www.fokoostech.com/) 3D-Printers. This community is mostly concentrated in a Facebook Group with it's inherent limitations.

This Github organisation was created to have a central place to gather all acquired knowledge, tips, tricks, models and software involving the Fokoos Odin FDM printers. It has no affiliation with the Fokoos company other than that Fokoos has approved using the 'Fokoos' name for this endeavor.

If you have anything that can help the rests of the community; feel free to add, amend or edit the content in these repositories.
